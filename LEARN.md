# Learn BART-based Reddit User Summary Generator

Welcome to the BART-based Reddit User Summary Generator project! This document provides an overview of the project and serves as a guide to help you understand and learn how to use it effectively.

## Project Overview

The BART-based Reddit User Summary Generator is a Python script that utilizes the Reddit API (via the PRAW library) to retrieve a user's submission history and generates a summarized text using the BART (Bidirectional and AutoRegressive Transformers) model. The script saves the user data to a text file and appends the summarized text to another file, providing a convenient way to analyze and summarize a user's Reddit activity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the BART-based Reddit User Summary Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up the Reddit API credentials by creating an application on the Reddit website and obtaining the client ID, client secret, user agent, username, and password.
4. Open the Python script and replace the placeholder values in the code with your Reddit API credentials.
5. Run the script and follow the prompts to enter a Reddit username and generate the summary.

## Script Workflow

The BART-based Reddit User Summary Generator script follows the following workflow:

1. Imports necessary libraries and initializes the Reddit API client.
2. Prompts the user to enter a Reddit username.
3. Retrieves the user's submission history and saves it to a text file.
4. Reads the contents of the text file and passes it to the BART summarization function.
5. Appends the summarized text to another file.
6. Displays the summarized text on the console.

## Customization

The BART-based Reddit User Summary Generator script can be customized according to your requirements. Here are a few potential customization options:

- Modify the file names and file paths for saving the user data and summarized text.
- Adjust the columns and data saved in the user data file.
- Customize the summarization process or explore different summarization models.
